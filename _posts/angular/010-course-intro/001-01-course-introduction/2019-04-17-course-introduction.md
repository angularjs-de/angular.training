[comment]: # [Little What] 
This is an interactive angular tutorial with additional content like videos, quizzes and tasks. 

We’re going to build an application for an existing REST-Backend - a simple book management system. You will learn how to show single or a list of books and to use forms with validation to create and delete books. 

Our primary goal of this task is also to create a simple to understand and maintainable application you and your team can use as exercise to create real-life applications.


[comment]: # [Why] 
We’re using a typical szenario for many web-applications these days. The chapters are build on each other with a multi-layered learning experience to guide in the most effective way to your learning goals.

[comment]: # [How]
The given topics and tasks are designed to help you understand Angular step by step without overstraining you but also not to bore you. As humans we learn most effective when stimulated with different visual, audio inputs and challenging tasks or communicative outputs. So learning is not just reading a book or watching a video or solving a task or exchange with someone else about the topic - it’s a combination of all of this.

[comment]: # [What]
So in this course we try to stimulate the different inputs and outputs of your learning journey and created a huge set of abstracts, texts, videos, tasks, challenges, quizzes, learning-groups and mentor-programs for you. This is different to most other courses you know and will push you a bit out of your comfort zone - that’s good, exactly that is needed to grow and achieve your goals. So enjoy this course and your growth!
